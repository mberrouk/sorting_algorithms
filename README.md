# Sorting algorithms & Big O in alx program

This repository contains the solutions for the "0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O" project in the ALX program. The project focuses on implementing various sorting algorithms in the C programming language and analyzing their time complexity using Big O notation.

## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are essential tools in computer science and software development. They allow us to arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending, which is crucial for efficient searching and data manipulation. This project explores different sorting algorithms and their performance characteristics.

## Sorting Algorithms

The repository includes implementations of the following sorting algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Quick Sort

Each algorithm is implemented as a separate C file and contains a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order. The code is thoroughly commented to aid understanding and facilitate modifications.

## Big O Notation

Big O notation is used to describe the performance characteristics of algorithms. It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's time complexity as the input size increases. In this project, we analyze the time complexity of each sorting algorithm and express it using Big O notation.

The time complexity of the sorting algorithms implemented in this project is as follows:

1. Bubble Sort: O(n^2)
2. Insertion Sort: O(n^2)
3. Selection Sort: O(n^2)
4. Quick Sort: O(n log n)
